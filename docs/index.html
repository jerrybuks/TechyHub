              When i joined techyHub, all hope was lost, having lost my job as a teacher, i wanted to do something
              better with my life, but did'nt know where to start. TechyHub gave me all the help and support i needed
              and
              am currently a UI/UX designer<p><em>Victor Onuoha.</em></p>
